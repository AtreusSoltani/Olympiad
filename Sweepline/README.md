> Imagine you have a vertical line that "sweeps" the plane from left to right. That's the main idea behind the sweep line.

## General Information
The idea behind algorithms of this type is to imagine that a line (often a vertical line) is swept or moved across the plane, stopping at some points. Geometric operations are restricted to geometric objects that either intersect or are in the immediate vicinity of the sweep line whenever it stops, and the complete solution is available once the line has passed over all objects.
